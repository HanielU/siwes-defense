# Conclusion

<div class="bg p-20px rounded-3xl">

During my Internship I was able to improve my skills as a front-end web developer. I particularly found that understanding underlying programming concepts is very important in order to train others efficiently.

I believe working in the Applications Development team in NNPC gave me valuable experience in my journey towards being a web developer.
